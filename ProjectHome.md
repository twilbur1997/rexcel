## An R package to interact with Excel files using the Apache POI java library ##

You can find the official version of this package published on CRAN under the name **xlsx**.  I have set up this google project to manage the _social_ aspect of the package.  I hope users will report the issues directly in the issues list, register for announcements, and have a place where they can obtain the latest development branch of the package.
