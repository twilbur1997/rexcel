If you are interested in this project and you want to report a bug,
request a feature, or just want to follow the development, please join
the Google group **R-package-xlsx**
http://groups.google.com/group/r-package-xlsx.

I have limited time to help with direct questions, so I hope that by
organizing a community of users, we can all help each other.  Please
use the Issues list to report bugs, take the time to read the
documentation and the Wikis, and suggest improvements.
